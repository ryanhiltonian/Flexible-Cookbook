# Flexible-Cookbook
Ryan Hilton

Service & Database Layer Project.

The purpose of the application is to provide a user-friendly recipe book
which lives on a user's smartphone.  The main unique characteristic of the
app is the ability to dynamically change between units of measure, right there
in the recipe itself.  The user can switch between cups, gallons, ounces,
tablespoons, mililiters, etc and have their recipe displayed that way.

This project fits into the purpose of the application by providing the backend
design, data structures, business logic, and other support features needed
for the application to perform.
