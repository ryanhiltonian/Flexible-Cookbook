# Flexible-Cookbook
App for recipes

This project was started in October 2018 by Ryan Hilton.

The purpose of this application is to provide a user-friendly recipe book
which lives on a user's smartphone.  The main unique characteristic of the
app is the ability to dynamically change between units of measure, right there
in the recipe itself.  The user can switch between cups, gallons, ounces,
tablespoons, mililiters, etc and have their recipe displayed that way.
More documentation about the purpose and use of this application is available 
in the "documenation" folder.
