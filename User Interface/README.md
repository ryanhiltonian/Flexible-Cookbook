# Flexible-Cookbook
Ryan Hilton

User Interface Project.

The purpose of the application is to provide a user-friendly recipe book
which lives on a user's smartphone.  The main unique characteristic of the
app is the ability to dynamically change between units of measure, right there
in the recipe itself.  The user can switch between cups, gallons, ounces,
tablespoons, mililiters, etc and have their recipe displayed that way.

This project fits into the purpose of the application by providing the layout,
interaction designs, views, pages, and screens that a user needs in order to use the app.  Everything the user sees and does with the application will be
through this user interface.
